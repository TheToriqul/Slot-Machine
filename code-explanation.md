## Constants

The game is configured using several constants:

- **MAX_LINES**: Sets the maximum number of betting lines a player can choose.
- **MAX_BET and MIN_BET**: Define the maximum and minimum bet amounts per line, respectively.
- **ROWS and COLS**: Specify the dimensions of the slot machine grid.
- **symbol_count**: A dictionary that maps each symbol to its count in the slot machine. This affects the probability of each symbol appearing.
- **symbol_value**: A dictionary that maps each symbol to its monetary value when forming a winning line.

## Functions

### check_winnings

The `check_winnings` function evaluates the results of a slot machine spin to determine any winnings. It takes the columns of symbols generated by the spin, the number of lines bet on, the bet amount per line, and the values assigned to each symbol. It checks each line for matching symbols across all columns. If a line contains matching symbols, the player wins, and the winnings are calculated based on the symbol value and bet amount. The function returns the total winnings and a list of winning lines.

### get_slot_machine_spin

The `get_slot_machine_spin` function generates a random slot machine spin. It constructs the columns by randomly selecting symbols according to their defined counts. This randomness ensures each spin is unique. The function uses a temporary list of all symbols, from which symbols are randomly chosen and removed to form each column.

### print_slot_machine_spin

The `print_slot_machine_spin` function formats and displays the result of the slot machine spin. It prints each row of symbols, separating columns with a vertical bar (`|`) for readability. This visual representation helps players easily see the outcome of their bet.

### deposit

The `deposit` function prompts the player to deposit money into their balance. It ensures the input is a positive integer, providing feedback and re-prompting if necessary. This initial deposit sets the player's starting balance for placing bets.

### get_number_of_lines

The `get_number_of_lines` function asks the player to choose the number of lines to bet on, up to the maximum allowed (defined by `MAX_LINES`). It validates the input to ensure it is within the allowed range, re-prompting if necessary. This allows players to strategically choose how many lines to bet on based on their balance and risk preference.

### get_bet

The `get_bet` function prompts the player to specify the bet amount per line. It validates the input to ensure it falls within the minimum and maximum bet limits. This function ensures that players cannot place invalid bets, helping to manage their balance effectively.

### game_spin

The `game_spin` function manages a single round of the game. It:
1. Gets the number of lines the player wants to bet on.
2. Prompts the player to place a bet amount for each line.
3. Checks if the total bet exceeds the player's balance, re-prompting if necessary.
4. Generates and displays the slot machine spin.
5. Checks for any winnings and updates the player's balance accordingly.
6. Displays the result of the spin, including any winnings and the updated balance.

### main

The `main` function is the entry point of the game. It:
1. Prompts the player to deposit an initial amount of money.
2. Enters a loop where the player can continue to place bets and spin the slot machine until they choose to quit.
3. Updates and displays the player's balance after each spin.
4. Ends the game and displays the final balance when the player decides to quit.
