## Development Environment (Optional)

If you want to modify and develop the game further, consider setting up a virtual environment to manage your Python packages and dependencies. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   In the project directory, run the following command:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:

     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   When you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

   ```sh
   deactivate
   ```
